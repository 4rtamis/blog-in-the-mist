## Pilot

<Clue type="default">
  **She will ascribe her own methods to the killer** (and technically, she
  wouldn't be lying), hinting that she thinks the killer somehow causes the
  victims to die of grief.
</Clue>

This is supposed to be a <Tag>tag</Tag>, a <Status>status-2</Status> and a <Spectrum>spectrum:5</Spectrum>. Attempting to catch the spook can spark
off a chase (catch:5), but the spook starts with faraway-3 and will vanish the first time the MC makes a
hard move (**Deny Them Something They Want**).

The security team is closely monitoring the place, with security guards and security cameras covering the floor. All access to <Location name="casino">the casino</Location> and other areas <Location name="hotel">inside the hotel</Location> is strictly limited to staff and guests.

### Test

This is an example of a bullet point list with big items, while below you have one with smaller items.

- The police could be reaching out to the crew for help with their mystery killer, especially if the crew previously worked with the police or runs an investigative agency.

- This point in the investigation: they have three seemingly unrelated suspicious deaths where the skinhead in the hoodie was placed.

The following is a smaller list, or so I belive :

- The owner of the Washboard.
- Sammy Jefferson Jr. (Sleeper), may contact.
- The crew to bring the Darnell Fox death to rest.
- Not so much shaken by a death in his club.
- As he is worried of interrupting his singer's lucky.
- Streak, old Sammy senses that his diva is on edge.
